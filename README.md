# Weather_Dashboard

Description
This project is a weather dashboard web application that shows real-time weather information for a city entered by the user. It displays current weather details along with hourly and 7-day forecasts using live API data.

#How the Project Works
* The user enters a city name in the search box.
* The application first fetches the city’s latitude and longitude using a geocoding API.
* Using these coordinates, weather data is fetched from the Open-Meteo API.
* The dashboard displays current temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, pressure, hourly forecast, and a 7-day forecast.
* Weather icons are shown based on weather codes returned by the API.
